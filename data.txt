There must be two separate folders for distorted and undistorted image sets
I have uploaded them to Onedrive as one single .zip folder called data

LINK: https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArUi3CefOACGoKFCgjc50FySuksgUg

- scans/: scans with distortion not corrected
	|-- calib/: calibration images with distortion
	|-- <object>/:
- scans_undistort/: scans with distortion corrected
	|-- calib_jpg_u/: calibration images without distortion
	|-- couple/: individual scan grabs *.png (removed to save space), meshes of each grab mesh<n>.ply, 
		final mesh couple_final.ply, and MeshLab project file mesh.mlp
	|-- teapot/: individual scan grabs *.png (removed to save space), meshes of each grab mesh<n>.ply,
		final mesh teapot_final.ply, and MeshLab project file teapot.mlp

Once downloaded, place it at root folder, same folder as where python_code/, cache/, and calibrations/ are placed

Then, import the deleted scans into grab_n folders like provided

If you want to start directly from alignment or even directly view the final results,
	there are *_final.ply as final products, mesh<n>.ply as individual meshes
