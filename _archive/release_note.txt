Release Notes:

This folder (python_code) consists of Python files
that were originally written for the 3D reconstruction, meshing,
and color mapping project of mine.

The development in Python has been suspended due to limited
functionality in Python IDE and a time constraint. For instance, 
the inability to rotate 3D visualization for analysis and debug purposes,
consuming too much time before the deadline.

Data (calibrations) has been transferred to MATLAB environment
with the aid of scipy.io. The remaining Python files (e.g. reconstruct.py)
will remain to function.

However, this (development process) will resume in the next months,
once the project has been done in MATLAB environment. Functions and
scripts developed after reconstruction will be transferred back to 
Python IDE. There will be changes from the MATLAB version to adapt
to Python once again.

UPDATE 06/14/2018:
Resumed developing in Python temporarily. Meshing script has been done
